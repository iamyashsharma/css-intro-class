	<p>Welcome back guys it's me your host yash sharma and in this website i am going to teach you CSS.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>CSS is a style sheet language which is used for describing the presentation of a document written in markup language like HTML.</b></p>
	<br>
	<p>It's not complicated, most of the people think that it's complicated but it's not.<br><br>You don't have to learn it or any other language just practice it daily then you will start to remember it automatically.</p>
	<br>
	<p>It's also related to HTML if you are a beginner then first checkout my website of HTML whose link i have already given to you in homepage.</p>
	<br>
	<p><b>Stle tag is very important to use beacuse without style tag you can not code you CSS and i prefer you to use your style tag b/w title and closing of head tag.</b></p>
	<br>
	<p>So, let's begin with our first topic which is <b>CSS Selectors.</b></p>
	<br>
  <p>In third class of HTML i have already told you about Id's and classes.</p>
  <br>
  <p>So, our all the points of this class have already been covered in HTML third class if you did not check that then i am giving you link of my third class.<br><br>I suggest that if you know all basics of HTML then continue with CSS otherwise go through all my classes.</p>
